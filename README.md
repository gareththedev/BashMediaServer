# BashMediaServer
A bash script to manage media files over multiple disk drives

This script will execute in a linux bash shell.
It can be used to generate hard links from one or more external drives into a
single shared media folder. Networked clients can then access the media files
from a single network share, even though the files in a single folder may be
sourced from different physical disks.

This script was in use from around 2008 to 2014 when it was superceded by a
purpose built application.
